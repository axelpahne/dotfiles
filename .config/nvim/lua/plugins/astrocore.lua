-- AstroCore provides a central place to modify mappings, vim options, autocommands, and more!
-- Configuration documentation can be found with `:h astrocore`
-- NOTE: We highly recommend setting up the Lua Language Server (`:LspInstall lua_ls`)
--       as this provides autocomplete and documentation while editing
